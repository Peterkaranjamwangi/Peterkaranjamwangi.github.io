**Poverty and the possible solutions in a Sociological perspective. **

We are currently  facing various problems that massively impact our way of life. Some of these problems are new while others have been there for decades and no permanent solution for these problems have been found. Poverty is one of these problems. Poverty can be referred to a situation or state where a person or a community do not have adequate financial resources and essentials to meet the minimum standard of living and being unable to meet their basic human needs. It is a pity that many politicians and citizens think that the poor are poor as a result of their own failures. They think that the poor do not work hard enough, they lack sufficient skills or just make bad choices in life. When they blame the poor, they suppose that the poor do not deserve the governments support and thus the governments neglect them. Poverty levels will only be decreased when people lessen the blame they give to the poor for being poor by understanding that  the notion ‘‘the poor lack motivation to work’’ is fake. It is possible to reduce poverty provided that the nation is willing to fund and implement appropriate programs and policies to help the poor in dealing with their daily difficulties. A sociological perspective is useful in helping us see ways in which culture, history, economic and political forces shape our individual choices and behavior.

There are various ways in which we can try to lower the poverty levels in our communities. When looking at solving the problem of poverty in a sociological perspective, various solutions can be implemented.

	

	Increasing federal aid for all poor workers. Increasing their earned income credits and child care subsidies are among the means for increasing this aid. This assists the children from poor families attain higher education and a possibility of them getting proper knowledge preparing them for better employment opportunities or giving them the knowledge to start and manage businesses. 

	Improving the schools attended by poor children and trying to balance the poor and the privileged in all schools attendance. 


    Improve the schools that poor children attend and the schooling they receive and expand early childhood education programs for poor children. To a large extent, people’s social class positions still influence the opportunities open to them. Starting out life in poverty means a greater risk of poverty in later life.

	


    Adopt a national “full employment” policy for the poor, involving federally funded job training and public works programs, and increase the minimum wage so that individuals working full-time will earn enough to lift their families out of poverty.


    Establish well-funded early childhood intervention programs, including home visitations by trained professionals, for poor families. Some sociologists, especially those writing in the 1970s and 1980s, have tended to explain poverty by referring to people’s moral failings, fecklessness or dependency cultures. Others have argued that poverty can be better understood as a result of the ways in which resources and opportunities are unequally distributed across society.


    Increase the supply of affordable housing.Provide poor families with enough income to enable them to pay for food and housing. In looking to explain poverty, sociologists have often tried to balance the relative importance of social structures (how society is organised) and the role of individual agency – people’s independent choices and actions.


    Establish universal health insurance and Provide better nutrition and health services for poor families with young children.The ways in which institutions such as public or welfare delivery services can negatively stereotype those experiencing poverty has also been shown to be important in stigmatising and disadvantaging those experiencing poverty.

**Conclusion**

Potentially successful anti poverty programs and policies to help the US poor include expanding their employment opportunities and providing them much greater amounts of financial and other aid. To help people in poor nations, gender and ethnic inequality must be addressed.
